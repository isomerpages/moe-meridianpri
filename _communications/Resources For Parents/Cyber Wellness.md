<p align = "justify">Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.</p>

**Parents as Partners**  
As parents, you are our key partners in ensuring holistic CW education for our children.  Through our CW lessons and programmes, the students receive these key messages:

*   Embrace ICT yet maintain a balanced lifestyle between the physical and the cyber world  
    
*   Harness the power of ICT for positive purposes  
    
*   Maintain a positive presence in cyber space  
    
*   Be a safe and responsible user of ICT

**Be the Role Model**<br>
Parents could set a good example at home in the use of technology and play an active role in guiding your children to navigate in cyberspace.

*   Show your children how to be safe, responsible and respectful online. The values that guide everyday interactions are applicable online.  
    
*   Practise asking for consent before posting photos, videos, and details online (including your children’s).  
    
*   Be mindful of your digital media use (or over-use).

**Resources for Parents**<br>
