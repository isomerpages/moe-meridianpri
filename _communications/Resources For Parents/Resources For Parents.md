<p align="justify">“Every parent a supportive partner” is an important piece of MOE’s key theme “Towards Student-Centric, Values-Driven Education”. It emphasises the importance of partnerships between schools and parents in bringing out the best in every child, and also the key role of the community in supporting our children on diverse pathways towards success.</p>
