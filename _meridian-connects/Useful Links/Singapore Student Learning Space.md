<h4>What is Singapore Student Learning Space?</h4>

<p align="justify">As part of its commitment to nurturing future-ready learners, all students in Singapore schools will be supported in their learning by the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning tools.</p>

<p align="justify">With the SLS, students will be able to learn better through the use of technology. Students will be able to learn anytime, anywhere, and at their own pace, whether independently or with their peers. Teachers will also be able to use the SLS to complement their classroom teaching, further enriching studentsâ€™ learning experience. We believe such a learning experience is essential to help your child to become an active and confident user of technology.</p>

<h4>Frequently Asked Question</h4>

The format of your username is a combination of the first 5 characters of your Name, the last 4 digits and the letter of your NRIC/FIN/BC, e.g. RACHE1234Z.

In rare cases, two or more students might share the same 10 characters. In such cases, their username may be affixed with a number, e.g. RACHE1234Z_01.

If you are still not sure of your username, please approach your teacher.

<p align="center"> <b>Alternatively, you may also login to SLS using MIMS ID and password. <br>This is also the preferred login method as it helps students <br>better manage their ICT account login details.</b></p>

<p><b> Q2. My account has been locked. What should I do?</b></p>
Your account will be locked if you try to log in with an incorrect password too many times.
Please approach your teacher to unlock your account.

<p><b> Q3. I chose to reset my SLS password through email but I cannot find the password reset email. What can I do?</b></p>
