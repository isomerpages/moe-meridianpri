<p>2025 was a special year for our Meridian community. We commemorated three
significant milestones: our primary school's 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary,
our MOE Kindergarten@Meridian's 5<sup>th</sup>year of offering quality
preschool education, and Singapore’s Diamond Jubilee (SG60). Just as we
owe our country’s transformation over six decades to our pioneers’ and
seniors’ selfless contributions and stoic resilience, our school could
not have come this far in the last quarter of a century with so much more
to offer without our Team Meridian leaders and staff. Guided by our shared
beliefs that each child matters and is&nbsp;different, and each one can
be enabled and empowered to learn, succeed in learning and make a difference,
we seek to live out our<strong> Meridian Promise</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This Meridian Promise can be realised at different levels. First and foremost,
it speaks of our faith in each <strong>Merdian of Promise</strong> – the
potential residing within all students, regardless of their starting points.
Next, it reflects the commitment by Team Meridian to grow and care for
each Meridian in the best way we know how. This devotion, we know, is the
most powerful when done with the trust and close partnership of parents.
Finally, the promise in Meridians is best brought out when they, themselves,
make their personal dedications to own and take charge of their journeys
of learning and growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are most encouraged by many inspiring stories of Meridians of Promise.
Meridians, past and present, reflected and shared how they have been guided
to learn, to love and to lead by teachers who believed in them, encouraged
them to embrace different learning opportunities, and adopted various approaches
to help them succeed. <strong>To learn</strong> means so much more than acquiring
academic knowledge and skills; it also involves developing curiosity in
learning and growing well in holistic areas. Above all, through this journey,
Meridians are <strong><em>seen</em></strong> for who they are and enabled
to uncover more about themselves – strengths, interests, gifts as well
as the value they possess and bring to others. <strong>To love</strong> is
to <strong><em>steer</em></strong> Meridians with the right values and dispositions
so that our young ones can chart and navigate confidently their own developmental
course. It is also about deepening their empathy, and enabling them to
form and maintain strong friendships and ties with others. While this journey
of learning and growth can sometimes be challenging, Meridians are <strong><em>shaped</em></strong> with
care so that each one possesses the internal resources <strong>to</strong>  <strong>lead</strong> oneself
with a growth mindset, resilience and adaptability, and in turn, lead others
in making positive differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we guide Meridians to learn, to love and to lead, Team Meridian keeps
our focus on delivering an academically robust curriculum that considers
our children’s strengths, learning readiness and potential. Across the
years, we have seen significant improvements in Meridians’ academic performance
in English, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages. We are immensely
proud of our 2025 Primary 6 cohort that demonstrated grit and did their
best for PSLE. We are most delighted to share that, like their seniors,
100% of the Class of 2025 is eligible for secondary school and furthering
their education in various schools.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Together, Team Meridian sees, steers and shapes our young charges so they
may, as our school song aptly depicts, <strong><em>scale the heights of learning</em> </strong>successfully
and <strong><em>move with the times yet remain rooted in timeless values</em></strong>.
We look forward to nurturing our Meridians of Promise for many more years
ahead in the company of our students, parents, alumni and partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>On behalf of Team Meridian, I wish you and your loved ones a joyous 2026,
filled with promise, possibilities and successes!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your partner in education,
<br>Lim-Chew Siang Jiun (Mrs)
<br>Principal</p>
