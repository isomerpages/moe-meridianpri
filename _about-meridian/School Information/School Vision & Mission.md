####  Our Vision
**Future Learners, Future Citizens, Future Leaders**  

<p align="justify">Meridian Primary is committed to providing a quality education that is well poised beyond the six years of primary education for the future of our students. Our school’s vision ‘Future Learners, Future Citizens, Future Leaders’ reflects the evolving educational landscape vis-à-vis a fast-changing VUCA world towards the 21st&nbsp;century.</p>

The future roles that a Singaporean needs to undertake, be it as a learner, a citizen or a leader, form the core of our vision. With this, our vision constantly takes bearing from the evolving factors in the horizon in anticipation of a different future for our students and nation. The school continues to refine and adjust its approaches accordingly so as to remain agile and relevant always.</p>
