    <td><p>Can my child bring mobile phone or smart watches to school?</p></td>
    <td><p style="font-size: 15px; text-align:justify;">We believe firmly that students should develop holistically at this age, engaging in healthy online and offline activities.  As such, students are not to bring their mobile phones or smart watches to school.  The purpose is to encourage them to interact with their friends and classmates face-to-face; to prevent them from being distracted by the devices; and to avoid inappropriate use of technology. Parents are required to write in to the school to ask for approval and approval is granted on a case-by-case basis.</p></td>

    <td><p style="font-size: 15px; text-align:justify;">Students who are absent during the Weighted Assessment (WA) or End-of-Year Examination (EOY) will not be eligible for make-up assessments.
