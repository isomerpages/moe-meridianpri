#### School History

<p align="justify">Meridian Primary School was established in the year 2000 to serve the neighbourhood in the Western sector of Pasir Ris New Town. The school started with 180 pupils in 5 Primary 1 classes and a staff of 8 teachers and 5 support staff. The school was holding at the formerly Coral Primary School for a year and moved to its present premises at 20 Pasir Ris Street 71 on 4 December 2000.</p>
