<b>Our Motto: To Learn, To Love To Lead</b>

<img src="/images/About%20As/School_Logo.jpg" style="width:350px;height:350px;float:center">


<p align="justify">Our motto “To Learn, To Love, To Lead” broadly defines the key domains of what we uphold and emphasize as a school towards our vision of “Future Learners, Future Citizens, Future Leaders”. It aligns well with MOE’s “Head, Heart &amp; Hands” approach as well as the teachers’ vision of “Lead, Care, Inspire”. It is about our thinking (reflections), our feelings (emotions) as well as our actions (deeds). It governs what we do as a school towards our vision.</p>

<p align="justify">Our motto undergirds what we emphasize as a school. It is our guide in what we do in Meridian: may it be academic learning, character molding or personal leadership.</p>

#### Our Values

_**· Care · Integrity · Resilience  · Responsibility · Respect ·&nbsp;Teamwork ·**_

<p align="justify">These school values support the school motto of “To Learn”, “To Love” and “To Lead” as it moves towards its vision of&nbsp; nurturing “Future Learners”, “Future Citizens” as well as “Future Leaders”.</p>
