<b>1)  Teachers' Day Celebrations 2022</b><br>
<p align = "justify">The school will be celebrating Teachers’ Day on Thursday, 1 September 2022 from 7.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m.  We welcome our former students to visit their teachers in Meridian Primary on that day between 11.00 a.m. to 12.00 p.m.  Former students entering the school are to ensure that they are feeling well, always have their masks on and continue to practise good personal hygiene. They are to be in their respective school uniforms to enter Meridian Primary, for the safety of our existing students.  We would also like to encourage all parents, former students and current students to leave appreciation messages for our teachers and staff on MOE Gratitude Portal <a href = "http://thankyoucher.edu.sg/">(ThankYouCher.edu.sg)</a>.</p>
