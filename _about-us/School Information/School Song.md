### School Song

<p>
To Learn, To Love, To Lead is the motto of our school.<br>
This is where we start our journey of discovery.<br>
Equip ourselves with knowledge, skills and values.<br>
To serve our country with love and humanity.
</p>
	
<p>
At Meridian, we move with the times.<br>
Yet remain rooted in timeless values.<br>
We make caring and sharing a part of us.<br>
Learning is fun for everyone.
</p>
	
<p>
We believe every child is unique,<br>
And everyone is special.<br>
With heart, soul and mind,<br>
We’ll scale the heights of learning.<br>
We’ll face the challenges as we climb till we reach our dream.
</p>
