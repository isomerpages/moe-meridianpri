School Song

\[break\]

To Learn, To Love, To Lead is the motto of our school.
This is where we start our journey of discovery.
Equip ourselves with knowledge, skills and values.
To serve our country with love and humanity.

At Meridian, we move with the times.
Yet remain rooted in timeless values.
We make caring and sharing a part of us.
Learning is fun for everyone.

We believe every child is unique,
And everyone is special.
As we grow and continue on our learning journey.
With heart, soul and mind,
We’ll scale the heights of learning.
We’ll face the challenges as we climb till we reach our dream.

Composer:
Mrs Carmee Lim (Former Principal of Raffles Girls’ School)
