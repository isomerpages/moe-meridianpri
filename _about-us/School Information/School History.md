### School History

<p align = "justify">Meridian Primary School was established in the year 2000 to serve the neighbourhood in the Western sector of Pasir Ris New Town. The school started with 180 pupils in 5 Primary 1 classes and a staff of 8 teachers and 5 support staff. The school was holding at the formerly Coral Primary School for a year and moved to its present premises at 20 Pasir Ris Street 71 on 4 December 2000.</p>

<p align = "justify">Meridian Primary turned 20 in 2020. To mark this significant milestone in our school’s history, our School Advisory Committee (SAC), has prepared several commemorative gifts for the staff and students of Meridian Primary and MK@Meridian. As part of our National Day celebrations, each student and staff will receive with a special edition plastic water bottle and a ‘Grow a Veggie’ Starter Kit. <a href = "https://www.meridianpri.moe.edu.sg/the-meridian-experience/20th-anniversary/">Read More.</a></p>
