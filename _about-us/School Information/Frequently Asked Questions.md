    <td><p style="font-size: 15px; text-align:justify;">At Meridian Primary, we believe firmly that students should develop holistically at this age, engaging in healthy online and offline activities.&nbsp; As such, students in Meridian Primary are not to bring their mobile phones to school.&nbsp; The purpose is to encourage them to interact with their friends and classmates&nbsp;face-to-face; to prevent them from being distracted by the devices; and to avoid inappropriate use of technology.</p></td>
