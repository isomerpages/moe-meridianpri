School Motto & Values
=====================
### Our Motto

<p align = "justify">Our motto “To Learn, To Love, To Lead” broadly defines the key domains of what we uphold and emphasize as a school towards our vision of “Future Learners, Future Citizens, Future Leaders”. It aligns well with MOE’s “Head, Heart & Hands” approach as well as the teachers’ vision of “Lead, Care, Inspire”. It is about our thinking (reflections), our feelings (emotions) as well as our actions (deeds). It governs what we do as a school towards our vision.</p>

<p align = "justify">Our motto undergrids what we emphasize as a school. It is our guide in what we do in Meridian: may it be academic learning, character molding or personal leadership.</p>
