<p align="justify">My team and I are committed to ensuring that Meridian Primary is a caring and enabling school that provides varied opportunities, experiences, and support for our children to flourish so that they can become the very best that they can be.</p>

<p align="justify">In Meridian Primary, our children <b>Learn for Life</b> as we provide strong academic rigor to meet their learning needs without compromising on their joy of learning. We have seen significant improvements in our children’s academic performance in English, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages. For our 2022 P6 cohort, like the previous cohorts before them, our children worked hard, did their best for their PSLE, and all of them are currently continuing their studies in different Secondary Schools.</p>

<p align="justify">To develop our children holistically, we <b>Nurture Character and Strength</b> by ensuring that our children are grounded in strong values and equipped with competencies and skills that prepare them for life. We want our children to be empowered to <b>Lead and Inspire</b> and believe that they are never too young to make a positive difference to those around them.</p>

<p align="justify">What we have achieved thus far as a school is the result of the hard work and heart work of the whole Meridian family, including our School Advisory Committee, parents and community partners. I am every grateful to the tremendous support and encouragement we receive as a school and will continue to work hard with my team to provide our children that amazing Meridian Experience.</p>

<p align="justify"> I look forward to an exciting 2023 as together, we continue to nurture Future Learners, Future Citizens and Future Leaders in Meridian Primary!</p>
