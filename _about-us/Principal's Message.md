<p align="justify">Having steered and empowered Meridians to navigate the journey of learning
and growth for more than two decades, we are excited to commemorate our
Silver Jubilee (25<sup>th</sup> anniversary) this year. This is made even
more meaningful with the celebration of our MOE Kindergarten@Meridian’s
(MK@Meridian) 5<sup>th</sup> year of offering quality preschool education
and Singapore’s Diamond Jubilee (SG 60). Threefold bliss indeed!</p>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">Crossing these momentous milestones, there is a lot for us to reflect
on and be exceptionally grateful for. As a nation, we owe our country’s
transformation over six decades to our pioneers’ and seniors’ selfless
contributions and stoic resilience, while Meridian Primary School could
not have come this far in the last quarter of a century with so much promise
to go further without its people – the Team Meridian co-captains who nimbly
co-steered our Meridian vessel with a common heart, soul and mind. They
are our mission-driven team of teachers and administrative support staff,
both past and present, who served with the able school leadership teams.
Our latest schooling section, MK@Meridian, built and established in midst
of the COVID pandemic, is a story of our MK Educators’ strength and unity.
Through the years, our school and MK have also grown from strength to strength
with the unyielding support provided by our school and community partners.</p>
