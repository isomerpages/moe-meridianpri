    <td><p align="justify"><br>The Meridian Story is one shaped by our remarkable Meridians as well as a mission-driven team of teachers and administrative support staff who served with the able school leadership teams led by Mr Eric Lim, Mdm Tan Mei Ling, Mr Lim Meng Wei and Ms Liza Rahmat. Through the years, we are also very thankful for the unyielding support provided by our School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, parents, alumni, and community partners. </p>

<p align="justify">Importantly, each chapter of our Story is meaningful only because of our children. It is my privilege to have this opportunity to join the school and build on the good work contributed by past and present Meridian teams.</p>
<p align="justify">It is our belief in Meridian Primary that every child matters. We treasure each Meridian as a distinct individual who can learn and succeed and make use of what he or she learned to make a positive difference. This shared belief guides us in designing a Meridian Experience that helps our children enjoy learning in an environment that is motivating, safe and respectful. In their important formative years, Meridians can look forward to growing in a space that encourages them to love learning and embrace challenges without fear of being judged.&nbsp; As they learn how to learn, they also know more about themselves and the value they can bring to others.</p>

<p align="justify">Our curriculum and co-curriculum pique our children’s natural curiosity, and provide them with varied opportunities to explore, reflect and relate their ideas and experiences, thereby developing important competencies like critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. Apart from developing strong character and values like resilience, respect, responsibility, care, integrity, and teamwork, they also learn how to be grateful as well as have appreciation for their parents and others around them.</p>

<p align="justify">The Meridian team is committed to deliver an academically robust curriculum that takes into account our children’s strengths and learning readiness, while enabling them to experience the joy of learning in the process. Across the years, we have seen significant improvements in our children’s academic performance in English, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages. We are immensely proud of our 2023 Primary 6 cohort who, like their seniors, worked hard and did their best for their PSLE. All of them are currently furthering their education in various secondary schools.</p>

<p align="justify">The Meridian Experience enables our children to Learn for Life as well as be Nurtured in Character and Strength so that they can, in turn, Lead and Inspire others. Much like my deepest wish for my two children, it is my endeavour to work with my team to enable each and every Meridian to acquire strong fundamentals and possess values-anchored character so that he or she has what it takes to seek and live a purposeful life.</p>

<p align="justify">I warmly welcome parents, students and partners to explore our website to find out more about education at Meridian Primary and invite you to join me in shaping the next chapters of our amazing Meridian Story.</p>

<p align="justify">I wish you and your loved ones a wonderful and joyous 2024.</p>
