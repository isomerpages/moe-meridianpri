<p>Having steered and empowered Meridians to navigate the journey of learning
and growth for more than two decades, we are excited to commemorate our
Silver Jubilee (25<sup>th</sup> anniversary) this year. This is made even
more meaningful with the celebration of our MOE Kindergarten@Meridian’s
(MK@Meridian) 5<sup>th</sup> year of offering quality preschool education
and Singapore’s Diamond Jubilee (SG 60). Threefold bliss indeed!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Crossing these momentous milestones, there is a lot for us to reflect
on and be exceptionally grateful for. As a nation, we owe our country’s
transformation over six decades to our pioneers’ and seniors’ selfless
contributions and stoic resilience, while Meridian Primary School could
not have come this far in the last quarter of a century with so much promise
to go further without its people – the Team Meridian co-captains who nimbly
co-steered our Meridian vessel with a common heart, soul and mind. They
are our mission-driven team of teachers and administrative support staff,
both past and present, who served with the able school leadership teams.
Our latest schooling section, MK@Meridian, built and established in midst
of the COVID pandemic, is a story of our MK Educators’ strength and unity.
Through the years, our school and MK have also grown from strength to strength
with the unyielding support provided by our school and community partners.</p>

<p>It is our belief in Meridian Primary that every child matters. We treasure
each Meridian as a distinct individual who can learn and succeed and make
use of what he or she learned to make a positive difference. This shared
belief guides us in designing a Meridian Experience that helps our children
enjoy learning in an environment that is motivating, safe and respectful.
In their important formative years, Meridians can look forward to growing
in a space that encourages them to love learning and embrace challenges
without fear of being judged.&nbsp; As they learn how to learn, they also
know more about themselves and the value they can bring to others.</p>
<p>Our curriculum and co-curriculum pique our children’s natural curiosity,
and provide them with varied opportunities to explore, reflect and relate
their ideas and experiences, thereby developing important competencies
like critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. Apart from developing
strong character and values like resilience, respect, responsibility, care,
integrity, and teamwork, they also learn how to be grateful as well as
have appreciation for their parents and others around them.</p>
<p>The Meridian team is committed to deliver an academically robust curriculum
that takes into account our children’s strengths and learning readiness,
while enabling them to experience the joy of learning in the process. Across
the years, we have seen significant improvements in our children’s academic
performance in English, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages.
We are immensely proud of our 2023 Primary 6 cohort who, like their seniors,
worked hard and did their best for their PSLE. All of them are currently
furthering their education in various secondary schools.</p>
<p>The Meridian Experience enables our children to Learn for Life as well
as be Nurtured in Character and Strength so that they can, in turn, Lead
and Inspire others. Much like my deepest wish for my two children, it is
my endeavour to work with my team to enable each and every Meridian to
acquire strong fundamentals and possess values-anchored character so that
he or she has what it takes to seek and live a purposeful life.</p>
<p>I warmly welcome parents, students and partners to explore our website
to find out more about education at Meridian Primary and invite you to
join me in shaping the next chapters of our amazing Meridian Story.</p>
<p>I wish you and your loved ones a wonderful and joyous 2024.</p>
<p>Your partner in education,
<br>Lim-Chew Siang Jiun (Mrs)
<br>Principal</p>
