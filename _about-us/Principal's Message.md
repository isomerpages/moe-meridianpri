<p align="justify">Having steered and empowered Meridians to navigate the journey of learning
and growth for more than two decades, we are excited to commemorate our
Silver Jubilee (25<sup>th</sup> anniversary) this year. This is made even
more meaningful with the celebration of our MOE Kindergarten@Meridian’s
(MK@Meridian) 5<sup>th</sup> year of offering quality preschool education
and Singapore’s Diamond Jubilee (SG 60). Threefold bliss indeed!</p>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">Crossing these momentous milestones, there is a lot for us to reflect
on and be exceptionally grateful for. As a nation, we owe our country’s
transformation over six decades to our pioneers’ and seniors’ selfless
contributions and stoic resilience, while Meridian Primary School could
not have come this far in the last quarter of a century with so much promise
to go further without its people – the Team Meridian co-captains who nimbly
co-steered our Meridian vessel with a common heart, soul and mind. They
are our mission-driven team of teachers and administrative support staff,
both past and present, who served with the able school leadership teams.
Our latest schooling section, MK@Meridian, built and established in midst
of the COVID pandemic, is a story of our MK Educators’ strength and unity.
Through the years, our school and MK have also grown from strength to strength
with the unyielding support provided by our school and community partners.</p>


<p align="justify">Having the honour to serve with Team Meridian leaders, staff and MK Educators in the past year since I joined in December 2023, I am humbled by the devotion to learning and teaching that they bring to the classrooms, and the love they have for each Meridian who passes through their hands. This can only be the result of how they are guided each day by their internal compass and map – one that points to the potential of each child <b>to learn</b>, <b>to love</b> and <b>to lead</b>. They <b>see</b> Meridians for who they are; they make time to know and appreciate so that the <b>promise</b> in each Meridian may be <b>uncovered</b> and nurtured, regardless of his or her starting point. They make use of different opportunities and approaches to enable and <b>steer</b> Meridians with the <b>right values</b> and dispositions so that our young ones can navigate confidently their own <b>course of learning and growth</b>. While this journey of learning and growth can sometimes be challenging, they <b>shape</b> Meridians with care so that each one possesses the internal resources to successfully <b>lead oneself</b> with a growth mindset, resilience and adaptability, and in turn, <b>lead others</b> in making positive differences. The fond schooling memories and successes relived by many Meridian alumni, and their attributions of the origins of their strengths-exploration, self-discovery, confidence-building journey to our school are testaments of the Meridian education.</p>

<p align="justify">As we do all these, Team Meridian keeps our focus on delivering an academically robust curriculum that considers our children’s strengths, gifts and learning readiness. Across the years, we have seen significant improvements in Meridians’ academic performance in English, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages. We are immensely proud of our 2024 Primary 6 cohort that demonstrated grit and did their best for PSLE. We are most delighted to share that, like their seniors, 100% of the Class of 2024 is eligible for secondary school and are furthering their education in various schools.</p>

<p align="justify">Together, Team Meridian uncovers, steers and shapes our young charges so they may, as our school song aptly depicts, <b>scale the heights of learning</b> successfully and <b>move with the times yet remain rooted in timeless values</b>. This is the Meridian pride and heartbeat.</p>
