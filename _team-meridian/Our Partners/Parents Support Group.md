<p align="justify">The Parent Support Group (PSG) is a great opportunity for parents to be closer to their children, understand them better and help them in their education journey. The children also benefit when&nbsp; the parents are more active in the school environment.</p>

<p align="justify">The PSG complements the school by aligning itself with the school’s objectives, supporting and strengthening the school’s programmes to improve our children’s well-being and learning.</p>
	
<p align="justify">The PSG listens to parents’ feedback on school operations, practices and programmes, and provides these feedback to the school. The PSG also facilitates the school’s communication to parents.</p>

<p align="justify">Parents who are actively involved in the PSG are better able to reach out to other parents and involve them in school activities. Over time, more parents can contribute to make the school environment an even more conducive place for learning.</p>

<p align="justify">The parent volunteers have been contributing their time, talents and thoughts to help make the school a safer place for our children to learn in, making school life more vibrant and exciting.</p>
