#### Vision

<p align="justify">A Confident and Caring Scientist in every Meridian.</p>

#### Approach

<img src="/images/The%20Meridian%20Experience/Science%20Dept/2024_Sci1.png" style="width:455px;height:460px;float:center">

<p align="justify">The Science programme in Meridian takes direction from the Singapore’s Primary Science Syllabus. The Science curriculum aims to enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate and provide strong science fundamentals for them to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.</p>


#### Goals
To provide our students with the:

*   <p align="justify">Experiences which build on their interest in and stimulate their curiousity about the environment we live in</p>
    
*  <p align="justify"> Scientific knowledge and concepts to help them understand the world around them</p>
    
*   Opportunities and platforms to develop skills, habits of mind and attitudes for scientific inquiry  
    
*   View of appreciating how science and technology has influenced and affected our way of life

#### Multi-faceted and Multi-disciplinary Approach
<span>Tier 1: For all pupils – Developing Interest, Knowledge, and Skills in Science</span>
* Experimental Investigation through Laboratory Lessons and Sparkle Kits  
* Appreciating and learning about Nature through Science Trails
* Linking scientific knowledge to real-world applications through Learning Journeys
* Stretching students’ interest in Science through the Young Scientist Badge Scheme
