#### Vision
<p>Passionate and Confident Maths Learners</p>

### Mission
<p>To develop self-directed learners who are confident and show interest in Mathematics.</p>

#### Approach
<p align="justify">The Math Department aims at developing students who are confident and interested in Mathematics. Hence, the department goals are to enable students to:</p>

*   acquire mathematical concepts &amp; skills for everyday use  
    
*   be self-directed in the learning of Mathematics  
    
*   develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application &amp; metacognitive skill

<p align="justify">The central focus of our Mathematics learning is problem solving. This is as reflected in the Mathematics framework, which comprises of five interrelated components: concepts, skills, processes, attitudes and metacognition.</p>
