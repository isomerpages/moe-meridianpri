#### Key Programmes
 <ol>
<li>Secret Garden - Mother Tongue Language Advantures</li>
		<p align = "justify">To nurture the joy of learning and promote the use of the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), Meridian Primary School has turned the MTL room into a magical hideaway – “The Secret Garden”. This provides students with authentic experiences in learning their Mother Tongue Languages, as they engage and explore in a stimulating environment. Students immerse in activities such as “Shopping Day”, “My Hobbies Day” and “Recruitment Day”. These activities excite students about learning while cultivating their interest and love for Chinese Language.</p>
	<p align = "justify">The MTL Secret Garden is the school’s signature programme. It is also featured in 2022 The Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS).

<p align = "justify">2.   Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight<br>
MTL Fortnight is conducted on a yearly basis to with the objective of providing students’ with different platforms to learn and gain better understanding and appreciation of our diverse cultural background and develop a love for the language.</p>

<p align = "justify">3.    Reading Programme<br>
Reading is important to enhance language skill.  We carry out a series of reading activities to encourage and cultivate the passion and habit of reading storybooks in our students.</p>

<p align = "justify">4.   Conversational Chinese-Malay (CCM)<br>
The Conversational Chinese-Malay programme (CCM) is introduced as an enrichment programme for non-Chinese and non-Malay students who are interested in learning Chinese or Malay language and culture. Communication through languages enhances social interaction. Learning Conversational Chinese-Malay would provide these students with the facility to communicate with native speakers, and to better understand and appreciate Chinese and Malay culture and values. It will also help students to enhance their rapport with their Chinese and Malay-speaking friends.  The CCM programme is non-examinable.</p>
