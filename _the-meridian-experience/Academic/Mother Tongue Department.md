<h4>Key Programmes</h4>

<p><strong>Secret Garden - Mother Tongue Language Advantures</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To nurture the joy of learning and promote the use of the Mother Tongue
Languages (MTL), Meridian Primary School has turned the MTL room into a
magical hideaway – “The Secret Garden”. This provides students with authentic
experiences in learning their Mother Tongue Languages, as they engage and
explore in a stimulating environment. Students immerse in activities such
as “Shopping Day”, “My Hobbies Day” and “Recruitment Day”. These activities
excite students about learning while cultivating their interest and love
for Chinese Language.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In line with our School Motto of “To learn, To Love, To lead”, Festive
celebration in Meridian is an event where students are actively involved
in the planning and implementation. Platforms are also created for P4 to
P6 students to take the lead in planning for actual day celebration and
conducting the activities they plan with different levels.</p>
