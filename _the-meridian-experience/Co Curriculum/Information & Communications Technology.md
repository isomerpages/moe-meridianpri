#### Key Programmes

<b>A) Learn ICT</b><br>
Student ICT Capacity Building Programme<br>
Taking reference from MOE’s Baseline ICT Standard and New Media Literacies for primary schools, lessons are designed in spiral-upwards to progressively build the ICT capacity of our students. Each department has infused Baseline ICT skills into their curriculum so that students benefit from an ICT-enabled learning environment.  The skills covered include:

*   Microsoft Office Skills (eg. Word, PowerPoint and Excel)
*   Computational and Coding Skills (eg. Code for Fun, Micro:bit, Scratch)
*   Digital Art (eg. Sketchbook Pro)
*   Web 2.0 Collaboration Tools (eg. Google Doc) etc

<b>B) Love ICT</b>
1) Student-led Cyber Wellness Peer-Advocacy Programme
To engage student voice and promote cyber wellness peer advocacy, selected students serve as Cyber Wellness Ambassadors to champion the safe and responsible use of ICT to their peers.  These ambassadors will be equipped with the necessary skills via training (such as attending the East Zone ICT Cyber Wellness Conference) and with the guidance and support from teachers.


2) Partnering Parents and Guardians in Reinforcing Cyber Wellness at Home<br>
To complement the cyber wellness curriculum in school, parents and guardians could set a good example at home in the use of technology and play an active role in guiding our children to navigate safely in the cyberspace.  We look forward to partnering parents in reinforcing consistent and coherent messaging for Cyber Wellness education:

*   Maintain a balanced lifestyle between the physical and the cyber world
*   Use ICT for positive purposes
*   Maintain a positive presence in cyberspace
*   Be a safe and responsible user of ICT

To help you to reinforce Cyber Wellness education at home, you may access Cyber Wellness resources

#### Highlights

*   The school commemorate the Safer Internet Day each year with a morning assembly sharing.  Students pledged their support to promote safe, responsible and positive use of digital technology during a recess activity.

*   Our students took part in the East Zone Cyber Wellness Conferences to learn how to resolve different Cyber Wellness conflicts.  They also picked up skills to design an advocacy project to spread cyber wellness messages.  
    

*   In collaboration with IMDA and MOE, the school piloted the Code for Fun programme.  The IMDA’s Lab on Wheels also visited us to provide our P3s with coding and computational thinking experience. The students had fun learning and coding their toy ball, ‘hackaball’, through visual block-based programming. The workshop equipped our students with technological knowledge to be future ready digital citizens in Singapore’s Smart Nation.  
    

*   In line with MOE’s effort to nurture “Future-ready and Responsible Digital Learners”, the school organised “Coding with Micro:bit Workshop” for our P4 students to increase their exposure to coding.  Through the fun and hands-on workshop, the students will improve in their computational thinking, which is the ability to communicate their thoughts in a structured and logical way.  The workshop also encourages them to be creative and promotes thinking “out of the box”.
