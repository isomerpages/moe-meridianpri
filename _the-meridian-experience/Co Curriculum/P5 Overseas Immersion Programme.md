#### Objectives

In Meridian, our students are provided with the opportunity to take part in overseas immersion programme.  The aims are to:

<ol>
	<li>Develop a heightened awareness of <b>environmental issues</b> and to reflect on other ways to <b>promote ideas through green habits</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p align = "justify">As the programme is usually linked to the school’s focus on eco-environment, the trip will also develop in the students a heightened awareness of environmental issues and to reflect on the other ways to promote ideas through green habits.</p>

#### 2017's Trip

In 2017, a group of students accompanied by teachers and a School Leader travelled to Taiwan in May.  The 4 Day-3 Night trip provided the students with several learning opportunities which include:

*   A formal visit and interaction with students at Sanhe Elementary School in the Jinshan District;  
*   Visits to Danshui Old Streets, Hong Mao Castle and Taipei 101; 
*   An exciting farm experience at Toucheng Leisure Farm in Yilan; 
*   Visits to Yangmingshan National Park and Nei Hu Tzu Chi Recycling Centre; and  
*   Xi Meng Ding and Pineapple Tarts-making in Taipei.
