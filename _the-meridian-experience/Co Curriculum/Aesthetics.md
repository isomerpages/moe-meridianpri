<b><u>Music Day for P1 and P2</u></b><br>
P1 & P2 Music Day is a yearly event where our lower primary students are given the opportunity to perform as a class on stage through singing and movement.
Through each performance, we aim to develop listening and ensemble performance skills in our students. At the same time, students gain self-confidence through performing on stage. Our students learn to respect their peers, look out for visual cues from their music teachers, and feel a sense of identity to the class.</p></td>

<b><u>Music Day for P3 and P4</u></b><br>
P3 and P4 Music Day is a platform for our students to make music together as a whole group. Led by our very own music teachers, students have fun learning rudiments of music through the experience.
