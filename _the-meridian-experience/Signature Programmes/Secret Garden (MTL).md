**The Secret Garden** **\- a Hideaway for Mother Tongue Language Adventures**

<p align = "justify">Behind a normal classroom door in Meridian Primary lies a Secret Garden, a magical hideaway where the learning of Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) comes alive.</p>

<p align = "justify">No child can stay unmoved at the sight of the little mushroom stools, colourful tables and tall trees in this make-believe garden classroom. Their excited whispers and laughter fill the room even before they begin their lessons in this special space.</p>

<p align = "justify">Mdm Anna Lim, Head of Department for MTL, was the one who came up with the idea of this Secret Garden. She was concerned that more children were struggling with the use of MTL, and wanted to make the learning of MTL a joyful experience for them.</p>

<p align = "justify">“We wanted to cater to what our children enjoy and make the learning of languages fun for them. We believe that this can nurture a love for the language, and help them pick up the language for life.”</p>
