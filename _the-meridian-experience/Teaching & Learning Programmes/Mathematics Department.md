<h4>Approach</h4>
<p>The school is committed to grow our students as problem solvers by providing
opportunities for them to develop their curiosity and interest in Mathematics
through authentic learning experiences. They are also taught problem solving
skills using the <strong><u>USSR</u></strong> approach, adapted from Polya’s
problem solving techniques.</p>

<h4>Key Departmental Programme</h4>
<p><strong><u>Meridian Marvellous Math Trail (3MT)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Meridian Marvelous Math Trail <strong>(3MT)</strong> aims to provide
students with an authentic outdoor learning experience.</p>
<p>Students will have the opportunity to apply mathematical concepts they
have learnt to solve problems, be aware that Mathematics is all around
them and how it is used in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Working in teams, students will be able to exercise sound reasoning and
decision making, manage complexities, explore possibilities to evaluate
and formulate solutions for the best outcome collaboratively.</p>
