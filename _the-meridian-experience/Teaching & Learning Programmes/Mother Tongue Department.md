<h4>Approach</h4>
<p align="justify">At Meridian, our approach to Mother Tongue Language learning is built
on three key principles that strive to drive student success:</p>
<p align="justify">We See - Every child carries the promise of growth. We recognize their
unique potential and nurture their strengths in language learning.</p>
<p align="justify">We Steer - Through engaging activities and cultural experiences, we guide
students to explore their Mother Tongue with curiosity and purpose, equipping
them with essential communication skills for the future.</p>
<p align="justify">We Shape - We develop confident language users who positively influence
others, embracing both their cultural heritage and 21st century competencies.</p>
<p align="justify">In alignment with MOE's Mother Tongue Languages curriculum, we emphasize
core language skills through a progressive approach, integrating technology
and 21st century competencies. Our teachers employ differentiated instruction,
ensuring every child progresses while maintaining their joy of learning.</p>
<p align="justify">We believe in strong parent partnerships, sharing regular updates and
practical tips for home-based language activities through our engagement
sessions.</p>
<p align="justify">Together, we nurture passionate Mother Tongue Language learners who appreciate
their cultural roots and are ready to thrive in an interconnected world.</p>
<h4>Key Departmental Programmes</h4>

<p align="justify"><b>1. Festive Celebrations</b><br>Through immersive celebrations of Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali,
students experience the rich traditions and cultural practices that make
these festivals meaningful in our multicultural society.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>2. Reading Programme</b><br>From 2025, we have enhanced our Mother Tongue reading programme with dedicated
curriculum time for reading. Primary 1 and 2 students will embark on a
30-minute weekly reading journey where stories come alive through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Interactive storytelling sessions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guided reading discussions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creative response activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging digital story platforms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">This structured yet engaging approach makes reading enjoyable while building
strong language foundations. The programme will progressively extend to
all primary levels by 2029, in line with the new Mother Tongue Language
curriculum.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>3. MTL Fortnight and Cultural Camp</b><br>Our annual MTL Fortnight brings language and culture to life through interactive
workshops, cultural performances, and hands-on activities. These immersive
experiences deepen students' appreciation of their cultural heritage while
fostering a natural love for their Mother Tongue.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>4. High-Ability Learners Programme &nbsp;</b><br>Our High-Ability Learners Programme provides enriched learning experiences
for students who demonstrate strong aptitude in their Mother Tongue. We
adopt and curate purposeful learning strategies to develop confident and
competent communicators.&nbsp; Through Inquiry-based learning, collaborative
projects, enrichment courses and creative activities, students build confidence
in their Mother Tongue while deepening their appreciation of the language.

</p><p align="justify"><b>5. Conversational Chinese and Malay</b><br>Our 20-hour Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) Programme enables Primary
3 students to explore a third language through interactive learning. Students
develop basic conversation skills while gaining meaningful insights into
another culture, fostering cross-cultural understanding and friendship.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Highlights</h4>
<p><strong><u>2024 (Partnership)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In 2024, our Mother Tongue Language learning journey extends beyond classroom
walls. Through collaboration with different partners in the educational
landscape, our students experience language learning in authentic settings.
From overseas virtual exchanges with Nanjing ShangYuan Elementary School
for our HAL students to collaborative projects with Pasir Ris Crest Secondary
School during MTL Fortnight Cultural Camp, these connections bring our
languages and cultures to life.</p>

<p><strong><u>2023 (MTL Fortnight)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In 2023, we launched our Mother Tongue Fortnight programme with an exciting
series of activities in our Mother Tongue Language Room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our Primary 3 students participated in a traditional games competition,
immersing themselves in the cultural heritage of various ethnic groups
whilst learning the values of teamwork and sportsmanship. Building on this
experience, our high-ability learners further honed their creativity by
designing their own traditional games during Higher Mother Tongue lessons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our Primary 4 students embarked on an exciting inquiry-based learning
to explore Singapore’s vibrant tourist attractions. Through collaborative
research and engaging presentations, they had the opportunity to share
their perspectives and showcase their creativity. This project emphasized
the inclusion of students' voices, encouraging them to step out of their
comfort zones and build confidence in public speaking.</p>
