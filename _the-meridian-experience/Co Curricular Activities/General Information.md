•	provide opportunity for all students to participate in a CCA<br>
•	leverage on SEL (Social-Emotional Learning) to provide for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)<br>
•	make school a fun and enjoyable experience for our students<br>
•	achieve depth and exposure in a CCA for Direct Schools Admission (DSA) after Primary 6 for entry into a Secondary School <br>
</p>
