#### Co-Curricular Activities

As part of the school’s efforts to deliver a holistic education, the school incorporated CCAs into curriculum time and designated Fridays as CCA Day.&nbsp; The objectives of the CCA Day are to:&nbsp;

*   provide opportunity for all pupils to participate in a CCA  
    
*   leverage on SEL (Social-Emotional Learning) to provide for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)  
    
*   achieve depth and exposure in a CCA for Direct Schools Admission (DSA) after Primary 6 for entry into a Secondary School and  
    
*   make school a fun and enjoyable experience for our pupils

All P3 to P6 students take part in a CCA in the first part of the morning, while the P1 and P2 students undergo the Programme for Active Learning (PAL).

The school offers a wide range of CCAs which include:

*   Sports &amp; Games: Floorball, Football, Sports Club and Taekwondo  
    
*   Performing Arts: Chinese Dance, Guzheng, Malay Dance and Show Choir  
    
*   Clubs &amp; Societies: Art Club, Environmental Science, Infocomm Technology (Computing) and Infocomm Technology (Media &amp; Production)  
    
*   Uniformed Group: Scouts
