  <summary><b>Guzheng</b> <i>(For Boys and Girls)</i></summary>

<p align="justify">Guzheng (古筝), is a Chinese musical instrument that has a history dating back to 500 B.C. GU (古) in Chinese means, old, long history. It is a popular instrument all over the world because of the elegant design.</p>

<p align="justify">In this CCA, students will learn foundational Guzheng techniques, including proper hand positioning, finger-plucking methods, and rhythm control. As they progress, they will also explore more complex pieces, enhance their musical expression, and develop ensemble playing skills. Through regular practice, students will strengthen their coordination, as playing the Guzheng requires both hands to work in harmony—helping to stimulate both sides of the brain, improve memory, and enhance concentration.</p>
	
<p align="justify">Our Guzheng ensemble emphasises teamwork, unity, discipline, and commitment. Students work together to achieve harmony in both music and friendship, gaining valuable life skills and forming bonds that extend beyond the CCA.</p>
