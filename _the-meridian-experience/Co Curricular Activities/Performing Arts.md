#### Chinese Dance 

**Chines Dance** _(For Boys and Girls)_

<p align = "justify">The Chinese Dance CCA aims to teach students basic dance movements and techniques. It instills appreciation of dance, music and the beauty of Chinese cultural.  The CCA is an excellent platform for the students to develop their motor skills through dance movement.  It also builds the students’ self-confidence and inculcates values such as teamwork, cooperation and discipline in them.</p>

We welcome students who have interest in dance, music and the Chinese culture to join our dance group!

Students are given the opportunities to take part in the SYF Arts Presentation as well as in various community performances.
