#### Football

<b>Football</b>&nbsp;<i>(For Boys Only)</i>

<p align="justify">At the heart of our football team is a strong sense of <b>teamwork</b>. We believe that individual talent can only take us so far, but when combined with the collective effort of each player, we can achieve greatness. On the field, we move as one unit, supporting and encouraging each other to reach our common goals. Our victories are a testament to the power of teamwork, demonstrating that together, we are stronger.</p>

<p align="justify"> In the face of challenges and setbacks, our team exemplifies <b>resilience</b>. The boys understand that the path to success is not always smooth, but it's the ability to bounce back and persevere that defines us. Whether trailing in a game or facing tough opponents, our players will show unwavering determination, never giving up until the final whistle. Resilience is a mindset that we cultivate within every member of our football family.</p>

<p align="justify">Those boys in football CCA are not just athletes; they are ambassadors of sportsmanship, <b>integrity</b> and fair play. Our players understand the importance of representing our school with pride and honor.</p>

#### Taekwondo&nbsp;

<b>Taekwondo</b>&nbsp;<i>(For Boys and Girls)</i>

<p align="justify">The Taekwondo CCA at Meridian Primary School aims to build students’ physical fitness and students’ foundation in Taekwondo Pattern (Poomsae). Taekwondo members will get a chance to participate in the annual competition such as the National School Games Taekwondo Competition or perform during the Year End Prize Presentation ceremony to gain experience and confidence. </p>

<p align="justify">Other than learning the technical skill of Taekwondo’s self-defense, students will more importantly learn life values such as respect and discipline through our training. Our training focuses on developing the character of a student in a fun and encouraging way as we strongly believe that good attitude and character will aid a child in his/her learning.</p>
