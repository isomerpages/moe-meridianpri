#### Floorball

**Floorball** _(For Boys and Girls)_

<p align = "justify">Team Meridian Floorball aims to develop not only the players’ skills and playing strategies, but also their character. Through the training programme, we hope to grow every member to become a confident, adaptable and resilient individual. At the same time, understanding the importance of care, respect and teamwork. This is done through the close guidance of the coaches and teachers. In addition to the usual training on Fridays, senior players who are preparing for the inter-school competition would be asked to attend another training session in the afternoon (from 3:30 pm to 5:00 pm) in the week.</p>
