#### Taekwondo 

**Taekwondo** (For Boys and Girls)

<p align = "justify">Taekwondo is an effective weaponless art of self-defense that originated from Korea and is one of the Asian martial arts included in the Olympic programme.<p>

<p align = "justify">The Taekwondo CCA at Meridian Primary School aims to build students’ physical fitness and students’ foundation in both Taekwondo Pattern (Poomsae) and Sparring (Kyorugi). Taekwondo members will get a chance to participate in the annual competition such as the National Primary Schools Taekwondo Championship or perform during the Year End Prize Presentation ceremony to gain experience and confidence.  </p>

<p align = "justify">Other than learning the technical skill of Taekwondo’s self-defense, students will more importantly learn life values such as respect and discipline through our training. Our training focuses on developing the character of a student in a fun and encouraging way as we strongly believe that good attitude and character will aid a child in his/her learning.</p>
