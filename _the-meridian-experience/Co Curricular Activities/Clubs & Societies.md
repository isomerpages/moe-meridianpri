#### Eco-Enviro Science Club

**Eco-Enviro Science Club** _(For Boys and Girls)_

<p align = "justify">The Eco-Enviro Science Club provides students with the opportunity to learn Science through hands-on interaction. Students are exposed to topics such as environmental conservation, habitat reforestation and global warning. Students also get to learn topics such as friction, forces, magnetism and other topics which may or may not be in their Primary Science Syllabus.</p>

<p align = "justify">Students also conduct field research by monitoring the population of various bird species in the school compound. Through observation, investigation and research, students get to learn more about protecting our environment and the different ways to enhance our natural biodiversity.</p>

<p align = "justify">By exposing students to a wide range of Science topics, we believe that students will grow up to be one who enjoys learning Science and cares for the environment.</p>

**Highlights**

*   Activities focusing on 3'R's - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle
*   Hydroponics planting (hi-tech farming)  
*   Field-based bird monitoring and research
