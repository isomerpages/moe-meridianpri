<p align="justify"> The Eco-Enviro Science Club offers students a hands-on approach to learning Science, encouraging curiosity and exploration beyond the classroom. Through engaging activities and real-world applications, students gain deeper insights into environmental conservation, habitat reforestation, and the impact of global warming.</p>

<p align="justify">Students also explore fascinating topics that extend beyond the standard curriculum, such as volcanic eruptions, sublimation, and other natural phenomena.

These observations allow them to investigate biodiversity and understand the importance of protecting our ecosystems.</p>
