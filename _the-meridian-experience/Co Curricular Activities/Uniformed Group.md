#### Scouts


**Scouts**&nbsp;_(For Boys and Girls)_

<p align="justify"> Cub Scouts is for boys and girls aged 7-12 years old. The objective of the Cub Scout programme is to develop the pupil in an environment that is intellectually and physically stimulating as well as providing challenges for the child to face and overcome.</p>

<p align="justify">  Cubs learn to manage themselves and take care of their peers. In doing so, they get hands on leadership experience.</p>

<p align="justify"> Cub Scouts meetings are opportunities for adventures, learning life skills, hikes, outdoor cooking, camps, knotting, craftwork and other scouting skills – all while making new friends.</p>

<p align="justify">Cub Scouts learn about the environment and regularly participate in meaningful projects to improve their surroundings. They are helpers in their homes and communities. The Scout Law and Promise guides them to do their best to be of service to others.</p>
