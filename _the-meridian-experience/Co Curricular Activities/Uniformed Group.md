#### Scouts


**Scouts** _(For Boys and Girls)_

<p align = "justify">The Meridian Cub Scouts is a vibrant CCA that provides a platform for self-development and self-discovery. It aims to engage and work towards developing the scouts holistically. It gives leadership opportunities for them to develop their characters through games, interaction in small groups and activities. They will also be given opportunity to engage in community services and participate in camps and competitions to interact and bond with Scouts from different schools.</p>

<p align = "justify">There is a progress and proficiency badge system for all three levels (Bronze, Silver and Gold Arrow) of scouting to prepare them to take on the challenge of attaining the highest award of Scouting – the Akela Award. Our comprehensive scouting programmes have attributed the attainment of the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Awards.</p>

<p align = "justify">The Scouts also participates in meaningful conservation campaigns such as the World Water Day, the Earth Day and even tried gardening at our national parks as part of our scouting efforts to save the environment.</p>

<p align = "justify">With such exposure, we hope to develop our scouts into motivated, independent, and adaptable individuals who are able to maintain gracious relationship with others and be a contributing member of the society.</p>
