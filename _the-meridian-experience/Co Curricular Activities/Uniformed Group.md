#### Scouts


**Scouts**&nbsp;_(For Boys and Girls)_

<p align="justify">Cub Scouts is for both boys and girls. The objectives of the Cub Scout programme are to develop the students in an environment that is intellectually and physically stimulating, as well as providing challenges for the students to overcome.</p>

<p align="justify">Students in Cub Scouts engage in a wide range of exciting activities including outdoor adventures, life skills training, hikes, outdoor cooking, camping, knot-tying, craftwork, and other core scouting skills. Along the way, they build lasting friendships and meaningful connections with their peers.</p>

<p align="justify">Our Cub Scouts also learn the importance of environmental stewardship and frequently take part in community service projects. At home and in school, they strive to be responsible helpers—guided by the values of the Scout Law and Promise. Every Cub Scout is encouraged to do their best and be of service to others.</p>
