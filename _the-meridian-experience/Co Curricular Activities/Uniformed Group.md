#### Scouts


**Scouts**&nbsp;_(For Boys and Girls)_

<p align="justify">Cub Scouts is for boys and girls aged 7-12 years old. The objectives of the Cub Scout programme are to develop the student in an environment that is intellectually and physically stimulating, as well as providing challenges for the student to overcome.</p>

<p align="justify">Cub Scouts activities provide opportunities for adventures, learning life skills, hikes, outdoor cooking, camps, knotting, craftwork and other scouting skills – all while making new friends.</p>

<p align="justify">Cub Scouts learn about the environment and regularly participate in meaningful projects to improve their surroundings. They are also helpers in their homes and communities. Guided by the Scout Law and Promise, Cub Scouts strive to do their best to be of service to others.</p>

<p align="justify">This year, 10 Primary 6 Cub Scouts were eligible for the Akela award, which is the highest award attainable for a Cub Scout.</p>

<p align="justify">Bayona Aedrielle Loren Balod&nbsp;from 6 Teamwork was awarded the Chief Commissioner’s Well-Done Badge this Semester. This badge is awarded to cub scouts that have exemplified the Scout Promise and Law and contributed to the well-being of their unit.</p>

<p align="justify">Lastly, Meridian Cub Scouts unit was proud to receive the Pennant Award by Singapore Scout Association in 2023, a testament to the school's remarkable attainment of the Frank Cooper Sands Award (Gold) for five consecutive years.</p>
