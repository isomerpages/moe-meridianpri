#### What is PAL?

<p align="justify">To encourage learning beyond the classroom, Programme for Active Learning (PAL) gives your child the chance to discover new interests, learn new skills and develop his character. Your child will have the opportunity during curriculum time to try out activities in sports and outdoor education, as well as in the performing and visual arts.</p>

<p align="justify">The focus in PAL lessons is engaged learning and teaching the whole child via a strong teacher and pupil relationship, and equipping our young with the necessary skills and values to thrive in a fast-changing and globalised future.</p>

<p align="justify">At Meridian, PAL is offered to all P1 and P2 students. It consists of modules of activities in two broad areas:&nbsp;<b>Sports &amp; Games</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Outdoor Education</b>, and&nbsp;<b>Performing Arts</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Visual Arts</b>.&nbsp; Lessons are carried out within the curriculum time on every Friday morning.</p>

#### What is the purpose/rationale of PAL?
<p align="justify">From 2022, PAL should be planned and enacted intentionally as one of the CCE lessons along with CCE (FTGP) and CCE (MTL) during curriculum time. At Meridian, PAL lessons are carefully curated to achieve the following knowledge and skills that have been specifically identified for PAL at primary 1 and 2 respectively:</p>

#### Reflection
<p align="justify">Students will be engaged in reflection at the end of every PAL lesson.&nbsp;This allows them to see their growth, strength, proud moments, and areas to improve on. At the end of each term, PAL teachers will identify students who best display our school values (i.e. Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Care, Teamwork, Integrity) and present to them the Awesome cards which are uniquely designed by our school to recognize their positive behaviors.</p>
