#### Approach
<u>Empowering Future-Ready Digital Learners at Meridian</u>
<p align="justify">At Meridian, we are committed to nurturing students who are digitally confident, responsible, and future-ready. In alignment with MOE’s EdTech Masterplan 2030, we adopt a whole-school approach to develop our students into 21st-century learners through a vibrant, ICT-enriched environment.<br>Our ICT programme is anchored in four key strands that support learning and teaching:</p>


**Strand 1: ICT Curriculum, Pedagogy &amp; Assessment**<br>
We deepen the use of ICT in the classroom, designing engaging, student-centred lessons that foster creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration.


**Strand 2: Student ICT Capacity Building**<br>
We build our students' digital literacy and technological skills in line with 21st Century Competencies. We also cultivate Cyber Wellness by guiding students to use ICT safely, ethically, and responsibly.

**Strand 3: Teacher ICT Professional Development**<br>
Our teachers are supported and encouraged to design tech-enabled learning experiences. We promote a culture of collaboration and professional sharing to enhance teaching with technology.

**Strand 4: Systems Support**<br>
We ensure the seamless integration of ICT through a well-supported digital infrastructure that enhances both teaching and learning, as well as administrative efficiency.



#### Key Programmes

<u>Student ICT Capacity Building</u>

<p align="justify">Taking reference from MOE’s Guide to the Development of Digital Literacy and Technological Skills, Meridian designs a holistic programme to develop our students’ digital competencies. This is aligned with the nine Digital Competencies (DCs) that scaffold students’ growth in becoming digitally literate learners.<br><br>
We adopt a Just-in-Time learning approach, ensuring students learn digital skills in authentic contexts using real-world tools and platforms. Across departments, ICT skills are infused into the Total Curriculum, enabling meaningful integration across all subjects.  These include:<br>
•	Microsoft Office Tools – Word, PowerPoint, Excel<br>
•	Computational Thinking &amp; Coding – through the Code for Fun programme<br>
•	Digital Creativity &amp; Art – using tools such as Sketchbook Pro
</p>

<u>Cyber Wellness: A Balanced and Responsible Digital Life</u><br>
<p align="justify">Digital fluency goes hand-in-hand with digital citizenship. At Meridian, we embed Cyber Wellness education into our curriculum to help students understand the importance of balance, responsibility, and respect in the digital space.</p>


**Cyber Wellness Ambassadors**
<p align="justify">Selected students are empowered to be Cyber Wellness Ambassadors, leading peer advocacy efforts to promote safe and responsible digital behaviour. These student leaders are equipped through structured training and supported by dedicated teachers.</p>
