#### Approach
<u>Empowering Future-Ready Digital Learners at Meridian</u>
<p align="justify">At Meridian, we are committed to nurturing students who are digitally confident, responsible, and future-ready. In alignment with MOE’s EdTech Masterplan 2030, we adopt a whole-school approach to develop our students into 21st-century learners through a vibrant, ICT-enriched environment.<br>Our ICT programme is anchored in four key strands that support learning and teaching:</p>


**Strand 1: ICT Curriculum, Pedagogy &amp; Assessment**

We deepen the use of ICT in the classroom, designing engaging, student-centred lessons that foster creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration.

#### Key Programmes

**A) Learn ICT**<br>
Student ICT Capacity Building Programme

<p align="justify">Taking reference from MOE’s Baseline ICT Standard and New Media Literacies for primary schools, lessons are designed in spiral-upwards to progressively build the ICT capacity of our students. Each department has infused Baseline ICT skills into their curriculum so that students benefit from an ICT-enabled learning environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The skills covered include:</p>

*   Microsoft Office Skills (eg. Word, PowerPoint and Excel)
*   Computational and Coding Skills (eg. Code for Fun, Scratch)
*   Digital Art (eg. Sketchbook Pro)
*   Web 2.0 Collaboration Tools (eg. Google Doc) etc

<b>B) Love ICT</b>
<p align="justify">1) Student-led Cyber Wellness Peer-Advocacy Programme
To engage student voice and promote cyber wellness peer advocacy, selected students serve as Cyber Wellness Ambassadors to champion the safe and responsible use of ICT to their peers.&nbsp; These ambassadors will be equipped with the necessary skills via training and with the guidance and support from teachers.</p>


<p align="justify">2) Partnering Parents and Guardians in Reinforcing Cyber Wellness at Home<br>
To complement the cyber wellness curriculum in school, parents and guardians could set a good example at home in the use of technology and play an active role in guiding our children to navigate safely in the cyberspace.&nbsp; We look forward to partnering parents in reinforcing consistent and coherent messaging for Cyber Wellness education:</p>

*   Maintain a balanced lifestyle between the physical and the cyber world
*   Use ICT for positive purposes
*   Maintain a positive presence in cyberspace
*   Be a safe and responsible user of ICT
