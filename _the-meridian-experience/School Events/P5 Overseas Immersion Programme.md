<h5>2023's Virtual Overseas Trip</h5>

<p align="justify">Our Primary 5 students started their June holidays with much fun and excitement as they embarked on a Virtual Overseas Immersion Trip to New Zealand and Thailand from 29 May to 31 May 2023!</p>

<p align="justify">Meridians first “flew” to New Zealand, where they learnt about the history of New Zealand and the Maori culture. The students also designed their own Maori masks. They also visited Arthur’s Farm where they saw many sheep and learnt many interesting facts about them!</p>

<p align="justify">After the visit to New Zealand, our Meridians then “flew” to Chiang Mai, where they not only learnt about the local Thai culture and history but also designed and painted their very own Thai umbrellas! Meridians also ‘encountered’ Asian elephants via live streaming from an elephant sanctuary. From a mahout, Meridians learnt more about the elephants and the ongoing conservation efforts.</p>

<p align="justify">Meridians also had school exchanges with students from Rosmini College, Green Bay School and Monfort Chiangmai School. Through virtual platforms, Meridians and their counterparts from the two countries engaged in a fruitful sharing of their daily school life and exchanged ideas about environmental conservation efforts!</p>

<p align="justify">On the final day of their virtual trip, Meridians took the opportunity to reflect on their learning and worked in teams to promote animal protection and environmental conservation. Some created posters while others promoted these green habits through and presentations.

The virtual overseas trip was indeed a memorable and enriching experience for Meridians!</p>
