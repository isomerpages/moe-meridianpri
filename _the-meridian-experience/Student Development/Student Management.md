<p align="justify">At Meridian Primary, we believe that it is important for every Meridian to feel safe, respected and belonged. Discipline guides students on the rules, consequences and strategies to help them learn in a safe and conducive environment.</p>

<p align="justify">In order to nurture, the school seeks to:
</p><ul>
	<li>	To be committed to remain inclusive for all, regardless of our children’s backgrounds, abilities and starting points. </li>
	<li>To inculcate SEL competencies in students in managing themselves, their behaviour and in their relationships with others in their growing up journey.</li>
	<li>To educate and empower our students to learn positive behaviours, raise them with great values and develop social and emotional skills that would last them a lifetime.
</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Our School Rules are designed to help every student understand their purpose in this Meridian community that they live and grow in. Strongly guided by our Motto “To Learn, To Love, To Lead”, it sets out to define their roles to take the best care they possibly can, of themselves, others and what’s around them.</p>


<p align="justify">School Rules:<br>
 1. LEARN to take care of yourself<br>
 2. LOVE and take care of those around you<br>
 3. LEAD and take care of your surrounding
</p>

<p>These 3 rules are guided by the&nbsp;<b>Code of Conduct</b>&nbsp; which states clearly the boundaries of acceptable conduct in school and in society.</p>
