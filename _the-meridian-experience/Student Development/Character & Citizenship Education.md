<h4>Approach</h4>
<p align="justify">In line with the school’s motto, To Learn, To Love and To Lead, Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) at Meridian Primary School adopts a whole-school approach to nurture students with the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to develop into confident, compassionate, and responsible individuals. Our CCE programme is designed to help students:
</p><ul>
	<li><b>Build strong character</b> by knowing right from wrong, regulating their behaviour, collaborating with others, and demonstrating fairness, honesty, and forgiveness</li>
	<li> <b>Develop a sense of gratitude and appreciation</b>, empowering them to make meaningful contributions to the community</li>
	<li><b>Cultivate a resilient mindset</b> to navigate life’s challenges with confidence</li>
	<li><b>Take responsibility</b> for themselves and others in appropriate and thoughtful ways</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
  
<p align="justify">We are deeply committed to the social and moral development of our students within a <b>Caring and Enabling School Environment</b> — one that is rooted in a strong <b>culture of care</b>. Guided by our school’s <b>Mission, Vision, Values, Motto, Philosophy, and Strategic Thrust 2</b>, our school-based curriculum is thoughtfully customised to provide positive and meaningful student experiences.</p>

<p align="justify">We embrace the <b>Head, Heart and Hands</b> approach to imparting values:
</p><ul>
	<li><b>Head</b> – developing knowledge and understanding</li>
	<li> <b>Heart</b> – nurturing values and empathy</li>
	<li><b>Hands</b> – equipping students with practical skills</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h4>Key Departmental Programmes</h4>

<b>Enactment of CCE</b>

<p align="justify">This holistic development is achieved through both <b>Instructional</b> and <b>Co-Instructional Programmes</b>, using platforms such as:
</p><ul>
	<li>CCE FTGP (Form Teacher Guidance Period) Lessons</li>
	<li> Key Student Development Experiences (SDEs)</li>
	<li>School-based initiatives</li>
	<li>Opportunities for personal application of values in real-life contexts</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<b>School-based Initiatives</b>

<p align="justify"><b>Social Skills</b><br>We focus on helping students develop <b>social effectiveness</b> by:
</p><ul>
	<li>Promoting <b>pro-social behaviour</b> such as empathy, cooperation, and respect</li>
	<li> Addressing and correcting <b>inappropriate behaviour</b> through guided reflection and positive reinforcement</li>
	<li>Replacing negative behaviours with positive actions to foster a supportive classroom culture</li>
</ul><p></p>

<p align="justify">To support this, specially curated <b>lesson packages</b> are delivered during <b>CCE FTGP periods</b>, ensuring age-appropriate and structured learning experiences. Additionally, <b>Social Skills cards and posters</b> are prominently displayed in classrooms and around the school to reinforce learning, serve as visual reminders, and encourage consistent application of these skills in daily interactions.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Education Career Guidance</b><br>As part of Education Career Guidance, we have the Mystery Lesson, where we invite a speaker to share their professional journey with students. The speaker discusses their job, what fuels their passion, the values required for success in their field, and the challenges they encounter. This session offers students valuable insights into various careers, helping them understand what it takes to pursue their own aspirations.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Growth Mindset Culture</b><br>Students are taught that everyone is capable of growth — that our brains are like muscles which grow stronger through challenge and effort. We encourage a <b>resilient attitude</b> towards learning, where students are taught:
</p><ul>
	<li>The value of <b>discipline</b> and perseverance</li>
	<li> How to approach challenges with confidence and optimism</li>
	<li>Practical <b>strategies</b> for self-management, goal setting, and seeking help when needed</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p align="justify">Each level adopts a <b>Growth Mindset statement</b> for the year. This statement is displayed in all classrooms and serves as a consistent reference point for teachers and students. 
Students also write their level’s <b>Growth Mindset statement</b> in their <b>Student Handbook</b> under Goals for Growth to reflect on their personal development. This reinforces a shared message across the school and encourages habits of success.
