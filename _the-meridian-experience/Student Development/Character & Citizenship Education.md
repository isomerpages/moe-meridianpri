#### Vision

<p>To cultivate values and character in students to become Future Learners, Future Citizens and Future Leaders.</p>

### Approach
<p align = "justify">In line with the school’s motto, To Learn, To Love and To Lead, the Character & Citizenship Education focuses on a school-wide approach through both the Instructional Programmes as well as the Co-Instructional Programmes for the holistic development of the child. The school believes in the Head, Heart and Hands approach to imparting values, where the students are engaged in knowledge (head), values (heart) and skills (hands). </p>
  

<p align = "justify">The school also leverages on our partnership with parents and other stakeholders towards building a strong character foundation in our students. In Meridian primary, we believe in students, staff, parents and community partners coming together to benefit the child, just like how the saying goes:  “It takes a whole village to raise a child”</p>
