**In Meridian, Discipline guides students on the rules, consequences and strategies to help them learn in a safe and conducive environment.**

<p align = "justify">We are committed to remain inclusive for all, regardless of our children’s backgrounds, abilities and starting points. We understand that every child is learning and a precious work-in-progress. Thus, there will be times where they faced real challenges in managing themselves, their behaviour and in their relationships with others in their growing up journey. <b>Therefore, we seek to educate and empower our students to learn positive behaviours, raise them with great values and develop social and emotional skills that would last them a lifetime.</b></p>
