<p align = "justify">
National Education comprises a wide range of school efforts that help students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans, understand the realities and challenges unique to our nation and foster a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore. A strong sense of belonging, reality and hope motivates our students to be active citizens. While they seek to achieve their personal life goals, they also see themselves as playing a contributory role in their families, school, and immediate communities. NE in CCE aims to be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making so as to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional and global issues.</p>

<p align = "justify">In Meridian, ‘Head’, ‘Heart’ and ‘Hands’ will be the focus of engagement in the NE Framework – where ‘Head’ is learning NE, ‘Heart’ is loving NE and ‘Hands’ is leading NE. This is in alignment with our School Motto of “To Learn, To Love, To Lead”.</p>
