<p align="justify">In line with the School Motto, “To Learn, To Love, To Lead”, we believe that every child is a leader. As part of their Meridian experience, every student will have the opportunity to have a lead while they are in the school.</p>

#### Approach

<p align="justify">The school focuses on three specific leadership skills pitched at different skill levels for all children.&nbsp; They are:

*   Communication Skills  
    
*   Teambuilding Skills  
    
*   Decision Making Skills  
    

The students learn to use cooperative learning strategies and are exposed to authentic problem-based learning and experiential learning experiences as they hone their leadership skills in varying capacities.</p>

#### Key Programmes
Student Council<br>
Cohort Leadership Programmes<br>
Structured Leadership Training<br>

#### Highlights
Festive Learning Journeys, where Student Leaders serve as guides for their fellow schoolmates.

*   Chinese New Year  
    
*   Hari Raya  
    
*   Deepavali
