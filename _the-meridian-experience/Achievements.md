	<p align="justify">Huge applause to our remarkable Meridians who truly shined at the recent Sayembara Bahasa Melayu 2023, Malay Language (ML) Competition! Their exceptional performance on stage in front of a captivated audience left us all in awe!<br>
Under the guidance of our dedicated ML teachers, our students seized the opportunity to showcase their linguistic prowess and acting skills among five other Pasir Ris schools. We are incredibly thrilled to announce that we clinched 3rd place for P2, P4, and P6 levels, and not to mention, Consolation prizes for the remaining three levels.<br>
This remarkable experience has not only ignited a deeper passion for the Malay Language among our students but has also highlighted their talents in bringing to life the enchanting characters of Malay Folktales.<br>
A heartfelt shoutout to School Leaders, Teachers and Parents who turned up to show their unwavering support and provided our students with a boost of confidence as they graced the stage. Your presence truly made a difference!<br><br>
Well done, Meridians! Here's to more achievements and milestones ahead!</p>

<h5>National Primary Schools Photography Competition</h5>
<p align="justify">
Drum roll please‚Ä¶ ü•Å<br>
for we are delighted to reveal a piece of wonderful news!
Our student Tan Hong Yu (5CA) from the Media Production Club emerged 2nd Runner-up in the Open Category in the National Primary Schools Photography Competition!<br>
His winning shot was inspired by the artistic look and feel of the architectural design of this newly opened skyscraper, called CapitaSpring. The photo depicted a circular bird‚Äôs eye view or holistic view of the 17th floor of the skyscraper. Hong Yu wished to express his impressions of city in nature, by showcasing this unique view of lush greenery nestled in the heart of the Lion City.<br>
We would also like to congratulate Alvi Adly (4CA), Schaffa Sahril (4CA) and Myesha Ambretta (5CA) for being shortlisted for the People's Choice Award. Their submissions depicted the Green Plan pillars of City in Nature and Sustainable Living. Thank you for casting your vote for them!<br>
The students' achievements would not be possible without the support and encouragement from their parents, and their teachers who patiently guided not only in honing their photography skills but also inculcated in them school values such as resilience - which the kids clearly demonstrated. Once again, thank you for supporting our Budding Photographers!</p>
