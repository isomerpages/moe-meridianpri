#### Home-based Learning for P5 (29 Sep 2022)

<p align = "justify">1. The school will be implementing Home-Based Learning for all Primary 5 students on Thursday, 29 September 2022. This will allow time for students to rest after their 3 days of outdoor activities at the P5 camp, while still embarking on self-directed learning at home.  P5 students will not report to school on that day. They will return to school on Friday, 30 September 2022.</p>

<p align = "justify">2. Teachers will be supporting our students with a combination of online and offline learning materials. All instructions will be indicated in their class learning plan which will be uploaded onto Parents Gateway one day before HBL. While we encourage your child / ward to adhere to the time-table, they may exercise flexibility in completing the work at their own pace as the HBL is largely asynchronous. The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) will continue to be the primary platform for online learning.</p>

<p align = "justify">3. Our teachers will continue to monitor the learning progress of your child and be in regular contact with you and your child to provide support during this transition.  You may contact your child’s / ward’s subject teachers should you need any clarifications pertaining to the respective HBL assignments.

<p align = "justify">4.  During school operating hours (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.), students should contact the school-based helpline at 6583 2125 for all SLS matters such as password reset, unlocking of accounts, as well as queries about lesson assignments.</p>
